I often changed machines, and I've gotten used to doing things a certain way.  So I wrote a 
few scripts that will help me get started with a new machine faster.

Of note, there are two install scripts you should take a quick look at:

./install.sh

Running this will get you:

1. A great color scheme
2. bashmarks (The ability to save pwd with s (bookmark) and go back to it again with g (bookmark)
3. git information on your prompt
4. collection of useful aliases

./installvim.sh

running this will get you:

1. vim with the ruby flag and pathogen
2. command-t
3. NERDTreeCommenter
4. NERDTree
5. tabbar
6. Other awesome bundles
